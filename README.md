# Unit tests training session

We're using the code from Cakefest 2017 basic workshop (after upgrading to CakePHP 4) as a base for the unit tests training session done at https://training.cakephp.org

## Setup

* Clone the project `git clone https://github.com/CakeDC/cakephp4-unit-tests.git training`
* Composer install `cd training && composer install`
* Create a database, configure `config/app_local.php`
* Start the built-in server using `bin/cake server`
